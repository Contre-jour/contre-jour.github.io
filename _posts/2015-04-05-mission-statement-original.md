# Statement of Purpose

I'm starting this miniblog to practice my English writing skills. That includes vocabulary and grammar, but writing a coherent text is equally important. That means that each post should have a start, middle and an end, and the text either needs to convey a message, be informative, or be a pleasure to read. That's my goal, but I'll make no promises.

In the beginning I intend to write about two or three paragraphs per post, but if my writing improves, I might manage full-length blog posts. For now, though, it's clearly a mini-blog. I hope to write at least once a week, mainly about web programming, but also about language, politics and random philosophical thoughts. Happy Easter!
