# Good enough

I've spent so much time tinkering with this blog that since Sunday, I've slept only 4 and now 6 hours per night. Instead of just [switching to Jekyll], and little by little improve the platform, I immediately proceeded to learn the platform well enough to create a tags page, set up images, convert the markup from PHP-Markdown to Redcarpet and tweak the CSS. This type of obsession with completedness (some kind of perfection) is similar to my binge watching habits. The goal when binge watching a TV series, however, is to complete it, while I hope to continue writing this blog for a long time.

Therefor, my aim in writing this short post is to encourage myself of creating a baseline first, and then gradually improve it as needed. This goes for blog posts as well: I spend far too much time tweaking the [dress blog post], while I could have written up the basic ideas first, and then published the blog post another day.

Note to self: Perfection isn't necessarily a bad goal, but you have to begin with *good enough*.
