# So called *relaxing*

From my previous [procrastination post], you could easily get the impression that I've avoided many of the procrastination traps that (I believe) many people fall into: watching movies and series, playing games, watching porn. I didn't actually think of these at first, because they are most *certainly* not what I'd call acceptable alternatives to doing something really productive. They are, however, perfectly acceptable options for relaxing.

Sometimes I'll binge watch a TV series (one that was somewhat extreme was *Breaking Bad* in the course of about a week). Sometimes I'll watch many too many somewhat educational videos (I particularly like *[Crash Course]*). Sometimes I'll play simple games (in the last six months I've basically only played a single game: *[2048]*). And I'll sometimes consume porn, mostly in written form on [Xhamster].

While these aren't really the most useful things I could do, they are infrequent enough that I mostly consider these habits to be harmless. I might even put these in the category of relaxing, though it's doubtful that binge watching *anything* actually helps to relax, and playing a game for an hour at a time is a little bit too much to be relaxing (I think 15 minutes would be okay, though).

Now that I'm continuing the theme about procrastination, I'd like to expand on the previous post by mentioning more "useful" things I do. I follow various RSS feeds, here roughly ordered by how enthusiastic I am about the content:
